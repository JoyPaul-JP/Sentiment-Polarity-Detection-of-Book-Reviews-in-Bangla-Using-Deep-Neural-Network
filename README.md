# Sentiment-Polarity-Detection-of-Book-Reviews-in-Bangla-Using-Deep-Neural-Network
The project titled "Sentiment Polarity Detection of Book Reviews in Bangla Using Deep Neural Network" focuses on analyzing and classifying the sentiment polarity of Bangla book reviews through advanced deep learning techniques. Bi-directional LSTM (Bi-LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) models were implemented with embedding-based text representation to capture linguistic context effectively. Comprehensive text preprocessing steps, including tokenization, POS tagging, punctuation removal, and tag removal, were applied to ensure high-quality input data. The models were developed using Python in Google Colab, leveraging TensorFlow, Keras, NLTK, and Scikit-learn for data processing, model training, and evaluation. The system achieved an overall accuracy of 92.54%, with 93.07% precision, 92.16% recall, and an F1 score of 92.61%, demonstrating its effectiveness in Bangla sentiment analysis.
